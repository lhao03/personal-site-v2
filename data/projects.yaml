  desc: I was the project lead on EcoEats, an Android app that helps users recognize the environmental impacts of their diets through intuitive terms such as kilometers driven, trees cut down, and water usage. Our team created a database of common food items with their carbon dioxide emissions. Using the Google Cloud Vision API, the user takes an image and we take the keyword with the highest predictive percentage and search our database for that keyword. I primarily worked on the backend by connecting the user's phone camera to the Google Cloud Vision API and also helped in implementing our designer's UI.

    Recipe Nest is a chatbot deployed on Slack, the Web, and through calls. Users can talk to the application as if they were talking to a real chef including all their dietary restrictions and food preferences and Recipe Nest finds a recipe conforming to the users' requests. A chatbot (Dialogflow) was trained to be able to pick out certain parts of a user's conversation and sends the query to an API which is then returned to the user in a presentable form.

  desc: A lot of my HTML for my old website was very repetitive. These HTML files got very long, and I made a lot of spelling mistakes because I was too lazy to scroll through a giant file and scan for mistakes. At the same time, I was learning Golang, and I found out Hugo was made in Golang, so I decided to choose Hugo as my static site generator. You are currently on that site!

    This ASL translator quickly translates either speech or text to ASL. Users can either type or speak directly to the web app, and in return, are given a translation of their speech in ASL. For common phrases, it returns a picture describing the motion, while other words are directly translated using the ASL alphabet. A Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API that utilizes neural networks can translate speech with astounding accuracy. The app is easy to use, and more efficient than searching up commands. This creates a pathway for those hard of hearing and those who have never been introduced to ASL.
