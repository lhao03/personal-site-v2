    Project lead on EcoEats, an Android app that helps users recognize the environmental impacts of their diets through intuitve terms such as kilometres driven, trees cut down and water user. Our app has a database containing common foods and their carbon dioxide emmisions, and we take the keyword with the highest predictive percertange and search our database for that keyword. Worked on backend by connecting phone camera to the Google Cloud Vision API. Also helped in connecting the Figma generated UI to the backend.

Users simply enter in all the filters they would like their recipe to contain and Recipe Nest finds a recipe conforming to the users' requests! We believe that making this application as accessible as possible reflects our goal of making it easy to get started with cooking at home and not wasting food!

    Our web app for Local Hack Day 2019, quickly translates either speech or text to ASL. Users can either type or speak directly to the web app, and in return, are given a translation of their speech in ASL. For common phrases, it returns a picture describing the motion, while other words are directly translated using the ASL alphabet. A Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API that utilizes neural networks is able to translate speech with astounding accuracy. The app is easy to use, and more efficient than searching up commands. This creates a pathway for those hard of hearing and those who have never been introduced to ASL.
