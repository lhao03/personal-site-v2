  desc: A lot of my HTML for my old website was very repetitive. These HTML files got very long, and I made a lot of spelling mistakes because I was too lazy to scroll through a giant file and scan for mistakes. At the same time, I was learning Golang, and I found out Hugo was made in Golang, so I decided to choose Hugo as my static site generator. You are currently on that site!

    This ASL translator quickly translates either speech or text to ASL. Users can either type or speak directly to the web app, and in return, are given a translation of their speech in ASL. For common phrases, it returns a picture describing the motion, while other words are directly translated using the ASL alphabet. A Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API that utilizes neural networks can translate speech with astounding accuracy. The app is easy to use, and more efficient than searching up commands. This creates a pathway for those hard of hearing and those who have never been introduced to ASL.
