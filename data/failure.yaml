- year: 2020
  fails:
    - I didn't drop out of a course that I knew I hated because I was hoping it would get better. It did not get better. In fact, its the worst mark I've ever recieved in a course.
    - My self esteem has taken a blow from losing alot of my strength. I used to be able to do 10 pullups; now I can do 5 if I really want to. This is my 10th (who's even counting) month without the gym.
    - Was forced to turn down 3 interviews (I basically rejected myself ðŸ˜Ž, thanks coop).
    - Failed an OChem quiz. 
    - Rejected as an undergraduate computer science TA twice in a span of 3 monthes.
    - Rejected from nwHacks team.
