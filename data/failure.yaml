  fails:
    - "Got some criticism on my project at work from someone I look up to. 
      I took that criticism pretty badly, and for the rest of the meeting I was unable to say anything else because I could not stop thinking about it. After reflecting, I realized this criticism wasn't targeted at me, but rather the project I was working on.
      One thing to always remember: You Are Not The Code You Write."

  fails:
    - I got a C in a Environmental Microbiology. I really hated the course content, and on the last day of the drop deadline, there was one seat left in STAT 251 (that I should of taken), but I stayed enrolled in Environmental Microbiology. 
      If you don't enjoy a course, don't feel bad for dropping it. Your time and money is valuable.
    - Failed an Organic Chemistry quiz. This one hits hard because I was planning to major in Chemistry, and it was my favorite course in high school. 
      Since I took Chemistry HL as an IB student, I was able to skip first year chemistry, which meant I was quite rusty when I took CHEM 233, more than a year after my IB exams. For the future, I'll make to revisit my foundations!
