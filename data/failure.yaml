- year: 2020
  fails:
    - I got a C in a Environmental Microbiology. I really hated the course content, and on the last day of the drop deadline, there was one seat left in STAT 251 (that I should of taken), but I stayed enrolled in Environmental Microbiology. If you don't enjoy a course, don't feel bad for dropping it. Your time and money is valuable.
    - Due to co-op policy, I was forced to turn down 3 interviews (I basically rejected myself ðŸ˜Ž, thanks co-op). I lost alot of sleep over this, because I worked hard on my resume and cover letters. All I can say is that this was an unfortunate event.
    - Failed an Organic Chemistry quiz. This one hits hard because I was planning to major in Chemistry, and it was my favorite course in high school. Since I took Chemistry HL as an IB student, I was able to skip first year chemistry, which meant I was quite rusty when I took CHEM 233, more than a year after my IB exams. For the future, I'll make to revisit my foundations!
    - Rejected as an undergraduate computer science TA twice in a span of 3 monthes.
