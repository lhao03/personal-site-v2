# personal site with hugo and go templates! 
### why hugo?

I'm a really messy when it comes to writing code and hugo forces you to keep your files very structured while generating html code for you from a yaml file so this was a winwin for me! I chose Hugo because I'm more familiar with the Go language and environment (I'm not very familiar with React or Javascript). I was partly inspired by [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0/website-v2). 

### try it out!
Assuming you have Hugo installed, (you don't need Go!), `git clone` this project and run `hugo serve`. To rebuild run `hugo`. To push run `.deploy/sh`.

### structure my css 
This is done! I made several css files for each subpage of my website.

## blog is wip!

Also wip! I'll probably clean up as I go.
