# personal site with hugo and go templates! 
### why hugo?
![github pages](https://github.com/lhao03/lhao03.github.io/workflows/github%20pages/badge.svg)

I'm a really messy when it comes to writing code and hugo forces you to keep your files very structured while generating html code for you from a yaml file so this was a winwin for me! I chose hugo because I'm currently learning go (and I'm not very familiar with react or javascript). I was partly inspired by [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0/website-v2). 

### try it out!
Assuming you have Hugo installed, (you don't need go!), `git clone` this project and run `hugo server`. To rebuild run `hugo`. To push run `.deploy/sh`

### in the future
- further template my website (such as the landing page)
- structure my css 
- create a blog
