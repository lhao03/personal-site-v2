# personal site with hugo and go templates! 
### why hugo?
I'm a really messy when it comes to writing code an hugo forces you to keep youre files very structured while generating html code for you from a yml file so this was a winwin for me! I chose hugo because I was learning go (and I'm not very familiar with react). inspiration from: https://github.com/jackyzha0/website-v2
