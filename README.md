# personal site with hugo and go templates! 
### why hugo?
I'm a really messy when it comes to writing code and hugo forces you to keep your files very structured while generating html code for you from a yaml file so this was a winwin for me! I chose hugo because I was learning go (and I'm not very familiar with react. The React/JS version of Hugo would be Gatsby). inspiration from: https://github.com/jackyzha0/website-v2

### try it out!
To try it out run `hugo server`. To rebuild run `hugo`. To push run `.deploy/sh`
