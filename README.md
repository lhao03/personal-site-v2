# personal site with hugo! 
## why 
I'm a really messy when it comes to writing code so hugo forced me to keep my files very structured. Additionally, I hated having to copy paste huge portions of html everytime I wanted to add new content so I decided to template my site. I chose hugo because I was learning go and thought this could be some good practice. inspiration from: https://github.com/jackyzha0/website-v2

## try it out
To try it out run `hugo server`. To rebuild run `hugo`. To push run `.deploy/sh`
