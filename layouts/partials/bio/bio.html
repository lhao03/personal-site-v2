        I'm a computer science student dabbling in microbiology and immunology
        at the University of British Columbia.
        My interests lie in bioinformatics and
        computational chemistry. Besides coding,
        fitness and health are also a large part of
        my life. I was once a vegan cross country
        runner and now an omnivorous weightlifter. 
        I would love to talk about fitness, chemistry, 
        or computer science related.
