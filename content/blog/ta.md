Tomorrow will be the last time I mark exams as a first-time TA while blasting kpop and eating dark chocolate. And I'm going to document some thoughts now from the perspective of a first time TA.
<!--more--> 
I'm writing this blog post at the end of a very exhausting day. Currently, I am TA for CPSC 210, [Software Construction](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=CPSC&course=210), a course that teaches all things related to OOP and test driven design. Now having experienced the course as a student and TA, I wanted to document some things I've felt during my first time as a TA.

<span>Firstly</span>, we are human too! We have all have jobs, courses, and a life to live. I'd be lying if I told you I answered every student's email the moment I received it. If I don't immediately answer a student's question it's usually because I'm in a bad mood, or I'm doing some research on your question to better answer you. In both cases, I'm making sure you receive the best answer from me. You wouldn't want me to answer your question when I'm tired and I wouldn't want to have you a half-assed answer either.  

Since us TAs are also human, we also make mistakes. This term I accidentally put 10 when I meant 100 and I never realized I made this mistake until my student asked why they had a 10% on a lab when the Autobot clearly said 100%! If you think there's a mistake, please tell me! Most of the time I'm inputting grades in a hurry so I'm not always double-checking. It's also lot harder to debug code in a virtual setting so let's be patient with each other!

<span>Secondly</span>, I'm nervous too! Maybe you feel nervous about asking a question, well I am equally nervous to answer your questions. Some days I feel less nervous, while other days I'm shaking in my chair while talking (thanks imposter syndrome). And don't feel bad for not knowing something, because sometimes I don't know either!

And <span>thirdly</span>, thank you to the students who give a quick hello to me, start up a small convo and students who just see me as a person too! I truly appreciate it! You do make my day when you ask how I'm doing or when you thank me for being your TA. My students will probably forget me as a TA but I'll always remember the students!
