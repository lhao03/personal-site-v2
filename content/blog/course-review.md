As a computer science student minoring in biochemistry, you can expect me to have taken a wide range of courses from data structures and algorithms to environmental microbiology. So I thought, hey, let's review some courses! <!--more-->

## Computer Science
### CPSC 110 üêÑ
At UBC, this is one of the first computer science courses you need to take to be admitted into the computer science program, regardless of faculty. I think it is one of the hardest and most eye-opening computer science courses I've ever taken. Firstly, the course uses Racket, a programming language based on Scheme, that most people have never heard of before. (This is a good thing about the course - you're not at a disadvantage if you have never programmed before. Then you're taught to use design recipes. Sticking to a general template helps out with planning out solutions to those infamous Leetcode problems! And then finally, you must trust the natural recursion. Having learned about recursion in my first year made implementing recursion in CPSC 221 a breeze! And of course, Gregor makes sure you eat, sleep, and breathe recursion üêÑ.  

*Would I recommend this course?* Yes!

*What I enjoyed about the course:* Gregor makes you focus on problem-solving rather than learning a specific programming language.

### CPSC 121
This course is the second required course you need must take to apply to the computer science major at UBC. At its core, CPSC 121 is an introductory proof and logic course with circuits thrown in for good measure. Most high school students have never been exposed to the content in CPSC 121 - in CPSC 121 you must think about the why vs. the how. I usually never use office hours, but for this course I did! The assignments can be challenging, but it also feels really good to churn out a proof by induction. My advice is to keep on top of your textbook readings and use those office hours!

*Would I recommend this course?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* Learning about proofs, logic and circuits can throw you into a new way of thinking that is typically not taught in high school, which is important for computer science.

### CPSC 210
I found this course one of the easiest computer science courses I've taken so far as a computer science student. This course is all about Java, OOP, and design patterns! This is also the first course that has a large project associated with it. The project requirements aren't that hard, but anything becomes hard if you don't have enough time to do it. This course uses the same video platform that CPSC 110 did. I liked drawing out relationships between classes, objects, and methods to understand what was going on. I'm also currently a teaching assistant for this course, so hit me up if you are in this course and need help. 

*Would I recommend this course?* Yes.

*What I love about the course:* The content in this computer science course is super important to writing good code. Design patterns are also super cool to learn about (they are used a lot in Android development if you're interested in that.)


### CPSC 221
This course is pretty much your standard data structures and algorithms courses. As someone who is not very good with this stuff, I found this course difficult at times (not to mention, it's taught in C++). And always remember to deallocate your pointers when you are done using them. Wait, what's a pointer again...

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* Understanding data structures and algorithms is not essential to writing code, but it is essential to writing good code, especially if you decide to dive into lower-level computer stuff (it's also pretty important information for those technical interviews). So make sure you pay attention in this course!

## Mathematics
### MATH 100
Just your basic first-year university differential calculus course. But this course is nothing like high school calculus. Just because you got 100 in high school calculus does not mean you can ace this course. Always attend lectures, do textbook questions, and attend office hours. Unfortunately, I never attended office hours and MATH 100 is one of my lowest marks. MATH 100 is also the *hardest* version of first-year calculus, but if you're interested in higher-level physics/maths/chemistry courses you should take MATH 100, as you can expect this level of math in these higher-level physics/maths/chemistry courses. 

*Would I recommend?* Yes.

*What I love about the course:* You don't need to remember this level of math to be a software engineer, but MATH 100 has many applications in other courses like physics and chemistry. 

### MATH 101
Just your basic first-year integral calculus course. I had the same thoughts on this course as I did for MATH 100.

*Would I recommend?* Yes.

*What I love about the course:* Same points as for MATH 100.

### STAT 251
There's not much to say about this course. It's a pretty standard statistics course that teaches you about all the different types of distributions, conditional probability, and more. Make sure you're caught up on the textbook readings and questions and you won't have too much trouble with this course.

*Would I recommend?* Meh

*What I love about the course:* This is pretty standard statistics that you can find in an IB textbook, so I think you could also teach yourself this content.

## Chemistry
### CHEM 123 (130)
If you have taken chemistry IB HL, this course will be a breeze for you. I took this course during the summer of COVID 19, so it was all online. This course comes with a VERY USEFUL course notebook. I still use that course notebook in my other chemistry and biology courses.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* It goes over a wide range of topics from thermodynamics, acid and base chemistry, and of course organic chemistry. It gives a nice review for those who took IBHL chemistry.

### CHEM 233
Since I'm not a chemistry major üò≠, this was the only organic chemistry course I was able to register for. I attended Jay's lectures, even though I wasn't registered for his class. Sadly, Jay will not be able to make any more T***p jokes. Lots and lots and lots of reaction pathways. Cheatsheets are your friend in this course. Also don't rely on your cheatsheets, they should only be used to confirm what you know. You should have nearly all the reaction pathways memorized. (I'm not sure if you will be allowed cheatsheets in person, so just memorize the pathways). But note that you can't just memorize the pathways, as you might need to use a combination of pathways to reach an end product. You should view these problems like puzzles and the general pathways as puzzle pieces. Make sure to stay on top of problem sets and attend office hours. 

*Would I recommend?* Yes! But only if you really really like organic chemistry.
 
*What I love about the course:* It's all about organic chemistry!

## Biology
### BIOL 112
I took this introductory biology course in the summer of COVID 19, so it was all online. Having not taken Biology 30 (grade 12), I found this course pretty manageable. If you remember your grade 12 biology you will be set.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* Also a nice review of grade 12 biology. I don't think anything new was introduced though.

### BIOL 200
This course helped me appreciate the biology of our body! My instructor, Vivienne, made the course engaging and taught the content in a fun and effective way. She also let us stamp and draw all over her zoom slides. Despite the course being all online, Vivienne made sure that we had many chances to engage with herself and the other students. Also, the course content is super interesting and helped me reinforce concepts I learned in MICB 202. Exams are mostly long answers based on data such as microscope images and experiments like DNA electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* The course gets deep into what's happening inside of our cells. Here's a funny video: https://youtu.be/eEFyPbsXdN0. I promise it's worth it!

## Microbiology
### MICB 201
I have strong words to say about this course. The content is really interesting for sure, but the way this course was delivered during the pandemic made it hard for me to learn the content. 

Some people think prerecorded lectures are the holy grail. Unfortunately, prerecorded lectures take forever for me to watch. A one-hour recorded lecture always turns into a three-hour lecture. Additionally, we were given 20-page readings per week and we had 6ish quizzes making up our entire mark (which I failed at least one). The quiz and final questions were ambiguous and very unforgiving. This course was essentially converted into distance learning, which I've had a horrible experience with in the past.

*Would I recommend?* No :( Not online at least.

*Why I regret taking this course:* There is no engagement with the professor and lots and lots of memorization of content. 

### MICB 202
One of the most interesting courses I've taken at UBC. The instructors were so forgiving during the pandemic and they worked hard to create unique and fun assignments. We learned about the immune system, viruses, and bacterial diseases, which is pretty fitting for right now. The instructors were also knowledgeable about their topics at hand and I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in their immune system and viruses. Exam questions were very fair and we even had an assignment in which we were given a mystery virus and tasked to find which known virus it was most similar with. 

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* While this course is also a lot of memorization of content the instructors were very understanding of student's circumstances and worked hard on creating super engaging and interesting assignments.

## Misc.
### ATSC 113
Easy booster but if you don't enjoy memorizing sentence after sentence after sentence, then this course will be a bore for you. I hated this course so much by the end. The easy booster mark was not worth the boredom and money.

*Would I recommend?* No :(

*Why I regret taking this course:* If you love going hiking, skiing, etc, this course may be for you. Unfortunately for me, I do none of those activities, so I've forgotten all the content from this course. Additionally, I don't do well with memorization heavy courses. This course being distance learning made it much worse.

### DSCI 100
I took the second iteration of this course, and I could tell the instructors worked hard to create a well-rounded syllabus. We used R in this course to do a lot of data analysis. The instructors also created their textbooks and interactive labs. There is also a final project associated with this course in which you choose a piece of data to analyze. The exams were all online and tested concepts and coding in R.

*Would I recommend?* Yes!

*What I love about the course:* I highly recommend this course if you are someone from a non-coding background interested in data science, but those who can already code should also take this course if you are interested in data science.
