I was browsing through nwPlus' Medium articles when I came across an article written by Anita, one of nwPlus' previous Co-Presidents. Wanting to read more of her articles, I clicked on her profile. To my surprise, I saw an article titled "Reverse engineering my 13 year old state of mind", and decided to read it. Her article was about her eating disorder, and one part resonated with me so much:

> I love seeing the shock on new friendsâ€™ faces when I tell them I donâ€™t love carbs (Not loving bread, pasta, or rice? Oh my!). I simply prefer other foods, but a small part of me wonders if this was an after-effect of the eating disorder. 

If you did not know, Rice and noodles are the main staples of many Asian cuisines. But even though I'm Asian (and eat lots of Asian foods) I don't eat rice or noodles (I do eat bread though). During family meals, I would always request no noodles and if congee was ever being served, I would cook my own meal. Reading about Anita's dislike to carbs makes me wonder, did my eating disorder take away a possible like for carbs? For a long time my parents believed my eating disorder was an act of a rebellious teenager - and I started to believe that too. But looking back, it was and still is an eating disorder which took over my life. 

My relationship with my eating habits as always been rocky - and I'll talk about they have created a lasting impact on me physically and mentally. 

# The Start
One day I forgot to eat dinner, and when I woke up the next I saw how tiny my stomach was. I liked how flat it looked, and then I started to eat less and less to prevent bloating. Voluminous foods like vegetables did not touch my mouth and I drank only 3 cups of water for an entire day; drinking liquids make yours tummy big. I also began running, because I admired how skinny cross country athletes were. Running and a horrible diet was the deadly combo that kickstarted my eating disorder.

# Weird Rules
At 13 I had no idea what were vitamins or macronutrients, so my diet became very unbalanced and unhealthy; I'm ashamed of it to this day. I ate foods based on their size; for instance, I would drink one cup of milk for breakfast, eat a clif bar for lunch and have a few pieces of pasta for dinner. I stayed far away from fibrous foods like leafly vegetables. To me, I only cared about how I looked after I ate foods. A single clif bar barely made me bloat, so I would eat one everyday. Writing about my eating habits now makes no sense (why would I eat such a calorie dense energy bar but run away from leafy vegetables?), but people with eating disorders are very good at tricking themselves. And unfortunately, I was doing a good job at tricking myself. 

But I was, and still am, a science nerd. So it wasn't too long before I learned about calories and carbs. What started out as eating food that was *physically small* became eating food that was low in calories. When I saw how many calories were in a clif bar I stopped eating them cold turkey. I started to eat vegetables again, but only under X amount of calories. No bread, no rice, no fruit; nothing with carbs and fat.

I was also obsessed with exercising, and created rules to follow regarding my diet and exercise. If I didn't run today then I was not allowed to eat a meal until I went for a run. And the length of my run dictated the calories of my meals. My weight plummeted to the lowest in my life.


A memory that haunts me during this period, was the time my family also went on a cruise. I spend 90% of the time being constipated and walking in circles around the cruise because I was scared to death of gaining weight.
